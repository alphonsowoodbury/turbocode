# TurboSoft: Realistic Bootstrapped Plan

**Reality Check Edition**

---

## The Honest Truth

You're one person with a full-time job/life. You want to build cool software that might make money someday. Let's plan accordingly.

**This is NOT a startup. This is a side project that might become a business.**

---

## Actual Starting Point (2025)

**What you have:**
- ✅ FastAPI backend (working)
- ✅ Next.js frontend (working)
- ✅ Docker setup (working)
- ✅ Good documentation habits
- ✅ Technical skills
- ✅ Vision for the platform

**What you don't have:**
- Users
- Revenue
- Team
- Marketing presence
- Native apps (yet)
- Time (probably)

**Reality:** You're starting from zero. That's fine. Most successful projects do.

## Year 1 (2025): Just Build One Thing Well

### Focus: TurboCode for YOU

**Goal:** Make project management tool that YOU actually want to use every day.

**NOT trying to:**
- Get 1,000 users
- Make money
- Build a team
- Scale infrastructure
- Support other people

**Actually doing:**
- Build macOS app (you use a Mac)
- Git worktree integration (you want this)
- AI mentor that's actually useful
- Polish the UX until it feels good
- Use it daily for your own projects

**Success = You switch from whatever you use now to TurboCode**

### Realistic Timeline

**Q1 2025 (Jan-Mar):**
- [ ] Finish current backend features
- [ ] Basic SwiftUI macOS app (read/write issues)
- [ ] CloudKit sync (just to learn it)
- [ ] Use it for TurboCode development (dogfooding)

**Q2 2025 (Apr-Jun):**
- [ ] Git worktree integration
- [ ] macOS menu bar app
- [ ] Basic iOS app (because you have an iPhone)
- [ ] Show a few friends, get feedback

**Q3 2025 (Jul-Sep):**
- [ ] Polish the things that annoy you
- [ ] AI mentor improvements
- [ ] Maybe a blog post about what you built
- [ ] If people ask, share the GitHub link

**Q4 2025 (Oct-Dec):**
- [ ] Decide if you want to make this public
- [ ] If yes: landing page, pricing page
- [ ] If no: keep using it yourself, that's fine too

**Year 1 Success Metrics:**
- Using TurboCode daily ✅
- Invited 5-10 friends to try it
- Maybe 1-2 are actually using it
- Learned SwiftUI and CloudKit
- Have a portfolio piece

**Revenue Target: $0** (don't even think about money yet)

---

## Year 2 (2026): Maybe Open It Up

**If Year 1 went well and you're still excited:**

### Option A: Keep It Private
- Polish for personal use
- Add features you want
- Share with close friends
- No pressure, no support burden
- **Perfectly valid choice**

### Option B: Soft Launch
- Put it on Product Hunt
- Free only (no monetization yet)
- See if anyone else wants it
- Learn from real users
- Keep expectations LOW

**Realistic outcomes if you launch:**
- 50-200 signups (most won't use it)
- 10-20 active users (realistic)
- 2-3 who love it and give good feedback
- Lots of feature requests you can't do
- Some bugs you didn't expect

**Year 2 Success:**
- Still using it yourself
- A handful of real users
- Learned a lot about user behavior
- Decided if you want to keep going

**Revenue Target: $0-500/mo** (maybe 10 people paying $5/mo if you add Pro)

---

## Year 3 (2027): Decision Time

**By now you know if this is real or not.**

### Path A: It's Working
- People actually use it
- Getting word of mouth
- Maybe add TurboNotes (because you take notes)
- Consider $5-10/mo pricing
- Still a side project, but viable

**Realistic Year 3 if it's working:**
- 500 total signups
- 50 active users
- 20 paying ($5/mo) = $100/mo revenue
- Covers hosting costs
- You're proud of it

### Path B: It's Not Working
- Nobody uses it but you
- That's okay!
- You learned a ton
- Built cool portfolio piece
- Archive it or keep for personal use

### Path C: It's Bigger Than Expected
- Hundreds of active users
- $500-1000/mo revenue
- People asking for features
- **NOW** you think about quitting your job
- Hire contractor for help
- This is the dream, but unlikely

---

## What "Success" Actually Looks Like

### Realistic Best Case (3 years)

**Users:**
- 1,000 total signups
- 100 weekly active users
- 30 paying customers

**Revenue:**
- $300/mo MRR ($3,600/year)
- Covers: Hosting ($100), APIs ($50), your coffee ($150)
- Not life-changing, but real

**Product:**
- TurboCode works great
- Maybe TurboNotes exists
- Native apps feel good
- Sync actually works
- AI is useful

**You:**
- Learned SwiftUI, CloudKit, production SaaS
- Built something real people use
- Portfolio piece for next job
- Confidence to build more
- Maybe this becomes bigger later

**This would be a HUGE success for a side project.**

## Anti-Goals (What NOT to Do)

### ❌ Don't Try to Be a Startup
- No investors
- No hiring
- No growth-at-all-costs
- No burning out

### ❌ Don't Over-Engineer
- Don't build for 1M users when you have 10
- Don't extract "platform" until you have 2 working apps
- Don't optimize prematurely
- Ship messy, fix later

### ❌ Don't Build Everything
- One app at a time
- Features you need, not nice-to-haves
- Say no to most requests
- Keep scope tight

### ❌ Don't Neglect Life
- Side project = nights and weekends
- Take breaks
- Don't burn out
- It's okay to pause

## Actual Next Steps (Next 30 Days)

**Week 1:**
- [ ] Buy turbosoft.ai ($12/year)
- [ ] Point it at current web app
- [ ] Simple landing page: "Building in public"
- [ ] Tweet about it once

**Week 2-3:**
- [ ] Basic SwiftUI app that shows issues
- [ ] Can create/edit issues
- [ ] Syncs with backend
- [ ] Ugly but works

**Week 4:**
- [ ] Use it for one real project
- [ ] Find the annoying parts
- [ ] Write down what needs fixing
- [ ] Blog post: "Building my own project manager"

**That's it. That's the month.**

---

## Rules for Staying Sane

### 1. Build for Yourself First
If YOU don't use it daily, why would anyone else?

### 2. Ship Small, Ship Often
Better to ship 10 small features than plan 1 big one.

### 3. No Promises
Don't commit to roadmaps, features, or timelines. Side project = no obligations.

### 4. Celebrate Small Wins
- First user that's not you? Celebrate.
- First dollar? Celebrate.
- App doesn't crash for a week? Celebrate.

### 5. It's Okay to Quit
If you're not having fun or learning, stop. That's fine.

### 6. Document Everything
Future you (or future employees) will thank you. You're already good at this.

---

## What About the Big Vision?

**The platform, the multiple apps, the $10M ARR?**

That's all still possible. But it happens AFTER:
1. You build one app that works
2. People actually use it
3. You learn what they need
4. You validate the patterns
5. You have time/money/energy to scale

**Don't skip steps.**

Build TurboCode first. If it works, build TurboNotes. If that works, extract the platform. If that works, scale up.

**One step at a time.**

---

## Realistic Financial Plan

### Year 1: $0 revenue
- **Costs:** Domain ($12), Hosting ($50/mo) = $612/year
- **Income:** $0
- **Net:** -$612
- You pay for this

### Year 2: $0-500/mo revenue
- **Costs:** Same
- **Income:** Maybe 10 users × $5/mo = $50/mo
- **Net:** -$12/year
- Almost break-even!

### Year 3: $100-1000/mo revenue
- **Costs:** $1,200/year (hosting grew)
- **Income:** 30 users × $10/mo = $300/mo = $3,600/year
- **Net:** +$2,400/year profit
- **Covers:** Nice laptop, coffee, maybe a weekend trip

**This is realistic. This is achievable. This is still success.**

---

## When to Scale Up

**Don't think about this until:**
- [ ] 100+ weekly active users
- [ ] $1,000+ MRR (sustainable)
- [ ] People asking for enterprise features
- [ ] You're turning away users/revenue
- [ ] Can't keep up with demand alone

**Then and only then:**
- Consider quitting job
- Hire help
- Raise prices
- Go full-time

**This might never happen. That's okay.**

---

## Comparison: Dreams vs Reality

### The Dream (from earlier docs)
- Year 1: $30K ARR, 1,000 users
- Year 3: $1.9M ARR, 50,000 users
- Year 5: $10M ARR, team of 20

### The Reality (this doc)
- Year 1: $0, 10 users (mostly friends)
- Year 3: $3.6K ARR, 100 users
- Year 5: $50K ARR if you're lucky, still solo

**Which to believe?**

**Reality for planning. Dream for motivation.**

Plan like you'll have 10 users. Build like you'll have 10,000. Hope you end up somewhere in between.

## Final Thoughts

### You Don't Need to Build a Unicorn

Most successful software businesses are:
- Solo developer
- $50K-500K/year revenue
- Sustainable lifestyle
- Happy customers
- No investors, no stress

**This is a great outcome.**

### You Already Have the Hard Part

Most people never start. You:
- Can code
- Understand architecture
- Write clear docs
- Have a vision
- Already building

**You're ahead of 99% of people who talk about building stuff.**

### Just Start Small

1. Build TurboCode macOS app
2. Use it yourself
3. Show some friends
4. See what happens

Everything else is optional.

---

## The Actual Plan

**2025:** Build and use TurboCode yourself
**2026:** Maybe let others use it
**2027:** Decide if it's worth continuing

**No pressure. No promises. Just build.**

If it becomes huge, great. If it stays small, great. If you learn a ton and shut it down, also great.

**The only failure is not trying.**

---

**Version:** 1.0 (Reality Check Edition)
**Date:** 2025-01-27
**Status:** Actually Achievable

---

Now go build something. Start with the macOS app. Make it work for you. Everything else can wait.

# Turbo Documentation

**AI-Powered Product Development Platform**

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for Turbo, a local-first AI development platform that revolutionizes how solo developers and small teams build products.

## Documentation Overview

This documentation provides complete specifications, architecture designs, and implementation guides for building Turbo from concept to production.

### Product Planning
- **[Product Requirements Document (PRD)](specifications/PRD.md)** - Complete product vision, requirements, and success criteria
- **[Development Roadmap](specifications/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md)** - Phased implementation plan with milestones and timelines

### Technical Architecture
- **[Technical Architecture](architecture/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - System architecture, component design, and technology choices
- **[Data Models & Database Schema](specifications/DATA_MODELS.md)** - Complete data model specifications and database design

### Integration & APIs
- **[API Specification](api/API_SPECIFICATION.md)** - Complete REST API documentation with endpoints and examples
- **[Claude Integration Strategy](specifications/CLAUDE_INTEGRATION.md)** - AI integration architecture and file-based communication protocol

### Deployment & Operations
- **[Deployment Plan](deployment/DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md)** - Installation methods, configuration, and production deployment
- **[Testing Strategy](specifications/TESTING_STRATEGY.md)** - Comprehensive testing approach and quality assurance

## Quick Start

### For Developers
1. Read the [PRD](specifications/PRD.md) for product context
2. Review [Technical Architecture](architecture/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md) for system understanding
3. Follow [Development Roadmap](specifications/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md) for implementation order

### For Users (Future)
1. Check [Deployment Plan](deployment/DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md) for installation instructions
2. Reference [API Specification](api/API_SPECIFICATION.md) for integration details

## Key Features

### Local-First Development
- Complete control over data and IP
- No external dependencies for core functionality
- Claude Code integration for AI assistance

### AI-Powered Workflows
- Automated technical specification generation
- Marketing content creation
- Project health analysis and recommendations

### Comprehensive Project Management
- Issue tracking and workflow management
- Document version control
- Multi-format content export

### Seamless Integration
- File-based Claude Code communication
- Git version control integration
- Multiple export formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML)

## Development Philosophy

Turbo follows a **documentation-first, AI-driven development** approach:

1. **Complete Specifications First** - All features are fully documented before implementation
2. **AI-Assisted Development** - Use Claude Code for implementation and code review
3. **Local-First Architecture** - No external dependencies compromise user control
4. **Quality-Focused** - Comprehensive testing and continuous quality gates

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Documentation and Specification Complete

**Next Steps**:
- Begin Phase 1 implementation (Core Foundation)
- Set up development environment and infrastructure
- Start with database models and API layer

## Contributing

This project follows the documentation-first approach outlined in these specifications. All contributions should:

1. Reference existing documentation
2. Update specifications before implementation
3. Follow the testing strategy outlined
4. Maintain local-first architecture principles

## Contact and Support

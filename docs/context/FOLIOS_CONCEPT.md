# Folios: Living Intelligence from Your Stream of Consciousness

## Concept Overview

Folios represent an evolution beyond smart folders - they are intelligent, self-maintaining collections that not only aggregate related entries but generate and continuously update purpose-built artifacts from your thoughts. Each folio becomes a living workspace where your scattered ideas coalesce into actionable intelligence.

## Core Architecture

### Traditional Smart Folders vs. Folios

**Smart Folders** (Current State)
- Filter entries by tags, dates, or metadata
- Display matching entries in a list
- Static view of existing content
- Manual synthesis required

**Folios** (Vision)
- Filter entries by sophisticated criteria
- Generate AI-powered artifacts from matching entries
- Living documents that evolve with new inputs
- Automatic synthesis and insight generation

## Folio Components

### 1. Source Material
- Tagged entries (#work, #therapy, #recipes)
- Contextual metadata (location, time, music)
- Temporal patterns (entries during morning routines, weekend thoughts)
- Emotional indicators (entries during stress, excitement, reflection)

### 2. Artifact Types

**Documentation Artifacts**
- `CLAUDE.md` files that auto-update with new implementation ideas
- README files that evolve with project understanding
- API documentation that captures all technical decisions
- Architecture documents that reflect design evolution

**Personal Growth Artifacts**
- Therapy session prep notes synthesized from recent reflections
- Meditation insights aggregated across practice sessions
- Personal patterns analysis (triggers, growth areas, victories)
- Weekly/monthly self-assessment reports

**Creative Artifacts**
- Marketing copy that refines with each product insight
- Story outlines that develop from scattered plot ideas
- Recipe collections that improve with cooking notes
- Design systems that evolve from UI observations

**Professional Artifacts**
- Meeting notes pre-synthesized from recent thoughts
- Project status updates auto-generated from work entries
- Learning summaries from technical explorations
- Decision logs with context and rationale

### 3. Intelligence Layer

**Synthesis Engine**
- Identifies patterns across entries
- Extracts key themes and insights
- Maintains consistency in generated artifacts
- Preserves nuance and context

**Update Triggers**
- New entry matching folio criteria
- Scheduled regeneration (daily, weekly)
- Manual refresh request
- Significant pattern change detection

**Quality Controls**
- Maintains source attribution to original entries
- Highlights conflicting information
- Flags significant changes for review
- Preserves historical versions

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: #ContextApp Development Folio

**Criteria**: All entries tagged #contextapp OR containing "Context" OR "journaling app"

**Generated Artifacts**:
1. `CLAUDE.md` - Development guidelines, auto-updated with new technical decisions
2. `FEATURES.md` - Evolving feature list with priority insights
3. `USER_INSIGHTS.md` - Synthesized understanding of user needs
4. `MARKETING.md` - Refined value propositions and messaging

**Update Behavior**: When you write "realized the app should focus on friction-free capture", the CLAUDE.md automatically updates its design principles section.

### Example 2: #Therapy Personal Growth Folio

**Criteria**: Entries tagged #therapy OR #reflection OR during "Personal" Focus mode

**Generated Artifacts**:
1. `NextSession.md` - Topics to discuss, updated continuously
2. `Patterns.md` - Recurring themes and emotional patterns
3. `Progress.md` - Growth victories and breakthrough moments
4. `Exercises.md` - Successful coping strategies and practices

**Update Behavior**: Evening reflection about anxiety automatically updates pattern recognition and adds to next session topics.

### Example 3: #Recipes Culinary Folio

**Criteria**: Entries tagged #recipes OR #cooking OR containing ingredient names

**Generated Artifacts**:
1. `MasterRecipes.md` - Refined recipes with accumulated notes
2. `Techniques.md` - Cooking insights and learned methods
3. `ShoppingPatterns.md` - Frequently needed ingredients
4. `MenuPlanning.md` - Successful meal combinations

**Update Behavior**: Note about "added more garlic to pasta sauce" automatically updates the master recipe with your preference.

## User Experience Design

### Folio Creation Flow
1. User identifies a theme or purpose
2. Defines entry criteria (tags, keywords, metadata)
3. Selects or customizes artifact templates
4. Sets update frequency and triggers
5. Reviews and approves initial generation

### Artifact Interaction
- Live preview of changes as entries are added
- Diff view showing what changed and why
- Manual override capability for AI suggestions
- Export artifacts to other apps or services
- Version history with rollback capability

### Intelligence Transparency
- Show which entries contributed to each artifact section
- Explain synthesis reasoning
- Highlight confidence levels
- Flag areas needing human review

## Technical Considerations

### On-Device Processing
- All synthesis happens locally for privacy
- Efficient incremental updates
- Background processing during idle time
- Optimized models for mobile performance

### Storage Architecture
- Artifacts stored separately from entries
- Efficient diff storage for versions
- Indexed for quick retrieval
- Synced across devices with conflict resolution

### AI Model Requirements
- Fine-tuned for synthesis vs. generation
- Context-aware of user's writing style
- Domain-specific models for specialized folios
- Continuous learning from user corrections

## Privacy & Control

### User Sovereignty
- Full control over what gets synthesized
- Ability to exclude sensitive entries
- Manual approval for significant changes
- Clear data lineage and attribution

### Privacy Preservation
- All processing on-device
- No external API calls
- Encrypted artifact storage
- Selective sync capabilities

## Future Possibilities

### Advanced Intelligence
- Cross-folio insights and connections
- Predictive artifact generation
- Collaborative folios with shared intelligence
- External data integration (calendar, email)

### Ecosystem Integration
- Export to task managers
- Sync with note-taking apps
- Integration with professional tools
- API for third-party artifacts

### Behavioral Intelligence
- Suggest new folios based on patterns
- Recommend artifact types
- Identify missing information
- Prompt for clarification

## Success Metrics

### User Value
- Time saved in manual synthesis
- Quality of generated insights
- Actionability of artifacts
- Reduced cognitive load

### System Performance
- Generation speed < 2 seconds
- Update latency < 500ms
- Storage efficiency > 10:1 compression
- 99.9% synthesis accuracy

## Conclusion

Folios transform Context from a passive repository into an active thinking partner. By automatically synthesizing scattered thoughts into purpose-built artifacts, they close the loop between capture and action, making your stream of consciousness immediately useful and continuously valuable.

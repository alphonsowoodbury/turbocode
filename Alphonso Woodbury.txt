## Professional Experience
### JPMorgan Chase — **Sr. Software Engineer, Data Platform**  
****Nov 2020 – Present****
****Architected enterprise-scale data platforms****  
- Defined and delivered a three-tier, event-driven processing ecosystem (Lambda ingestion, Step Function orchestration, AWS Glue framework) that became the ****enterprise standard**** for onboarding and processing new data sources  
- Redesigned a ****single-team pipeline into a SEAL-agnostic, multi-tenant platform****, eliminating scaling bottlenecks and enabling adoption across unlimited business units  
- Expanded platform capabilities to support 5+ file formats, multi-region deployments, and automated metadata generation, ensuring compliance across diverse regulatory requirements  
- Created a ****metadata enrichment framework for 150K+ datasets****, automating discovery, governance, and compliance workflows across the bank  
****Elevated organizational engineering maturity****  
- Optimized distributed Solr search infrastructure from multi-second latency to ****sub-2 second queries at millions of daily requests****, driving adoption of search by additional product lines  
- Introduced ****reusable architectural patterns**** (Factory, Strategy, Observer) to accelerate feature delivery, reduce duplicated engineering, and standardize best practices  
- Championed ****data contract modeling**** with multiple stakeholders, ensuring consistency, schema quality, and interoperability across diverse data pipelines  
****Institutionalized operational excellence and risk management****  
- Established enterprise-wide ****error handling and compliance frameworks**** (custom exception library, JSON logging, automated data scrubbing), reducing production incidents while meeting audit standards  
- Designed ****defense-in-depth safeguards**** (tenant isolation, validation pipelines, graceful degradation) to mitigate technical and operational risks at scale  
- Implemented proactive validation, schema inference, and intelligent auditing systems that minimized data quality issues before reaching production  
****Drove cross-organizational alignment and influence****  
- Identified and resolved critical SEAL multi-tenancy bottlenecks, prototyped solutions, and socialized the architecture across teams — setting the ****enterprise direction for platform scalability****  
- Collaborated with compliance, security, and infrastructure teams on AWS optimization, regulatory audit trails, and data governance guardrails  
- Demonstrated ownership beyond scope by shaping unified platform capabilities from diverse business-unit requirements, ensuring solutions met ****enterprise-wide, not just local, needs****

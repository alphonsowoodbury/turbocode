Architected complete three-tier data processing ecosystem comprising event-driven Lambda acquisition service, intelligent state machine orchestration, and advanced AWS Glue processing framework. Transformed single-use solution into enterprise platform serving unlimited SEALs through SEAL-agnostic architecture eliminating multi-tenancy bottlenecks. Platform now processes 5+ file formats automatically, supports unlimited SEAL configuration, operates across multi-region deployments, and provides comprehensive metadata generation for regulatory compliance. Built metadata enrichment framework for catalog containing 150K+ datasets automating data discovery and governance workflows across the enterprise. Optimized distributed search infrastructure achieving sub-2 second query response times handling millions of daily queries through fine-tuned Solr indexing. Elevated team from single-use scripts to enterprise platform engineering. Evolved codebase demonstrating architectural maturity: Strategic decisions multiplied solution's value proposition from serving one team to serving the entire enterprise. Implemented reusable infrastructure patterns (Factory, Strategy, Observer). Collaborated with multiple stakeholders on data contract modeling ensuring consistent schemas and quality standards across diverse data sources. Built operational excellence and risk management standards. Implemented comprehensive error handling with 7+ custom exception types, structured JSON logging, and automated data scrubbing for non-production environments. Built proactive risk management approach reducing data processing incidents through environment-aware processing, intelligent data validation, schema inference, and complete audit trail. Created defense-in-depth strategies protecting against technical risks (multi-tenant architecture preventing cross-contamination, input validation, malformed data detection) and operational risks (graceful degradation, timeout handling, configuration-driven approach). Demonstrated ownership beyond assigned scope. Proactively identified SEAL multi-tenancy bottleneck and invested significant time researching, prototyping, and testing to validate approach before proposing enterprise solution. Collaborated with multiple business units understanding diverse requirements and translating into unified platform capabilities ensuring solution serves enterprise needs rather than just immediate requirements. Worked directly with infrastructure, compliance, and security teams on AWS optimization, audit trail requirements, and implementing controls that detect potentially malformed data. Commitment to excellence evident in comprehensive error handling, detailed logging, and extensive testing ensuring platform reliability across all deployment environments.","technologies":["Python","SQL","Bash","Terraform","AWS Lambda","AWS Step Functions","AWS S3","AWS Glue","AWS DynamoDB","AWS EventBridge","AWS ECS","Solr"]},{"title":"Software Engineer II, Data Discovery (Founding Engineer)","company":"JPMorganChase","end_date":"2023-03","location":null,"start_date":"2021-11","description":"Built metadata enrichment framework for data catalog containing 150K+ datasets, automating data discovery and governance workflows while improving data quality tracking.
